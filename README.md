# Augmented-Reality-education-app
An augmented reality based education app created using Unity3D and Android Studio

This app currently has 2 modules: one video player module and one 3D model viewer module.

The video player module will allow deployment of 3d videos(here a video on Arduino and a video explaining the structure of the human heart) in the physical environment through the mobile camera, without an active internet connection.

The 3D model viewer module will allow deployment of 3d models(here a solar system, human heart, human skull, robot models) in the physical environment through the mobile camera, without an active internet connection.
